First, I identified my deviceâ€™s IP address using the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
ipconfig
This displayed the local IP address of my machine (e.g., 192.168.1.202), which was used as the target for scanning. Next, I used Nmap to perform a full TCP port scan on the target IP. The command used was:
nmap -p- 192.168.1.202 -p- tells Nmap to scan all 65,535 TCP ports. This helps identify all open ports and the services running on them.
After the scan completed, I reviewed the results to see which ports were open and what services were associated with them. This information is essential for:
Identifying potential vulnerabilities
Understanding what services are exposed on the network
Taking action to secure unnecessary or risky open ports
